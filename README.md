# Year1 Python Project
 
The codee must be designed to achieve a goal – it cannot be simply a set of sections of code to demonstrate aspects of Python. The program should show evidence of at least the basic use of loops, branching, data structures and filehandling and any further advanced features that might be needed to achieve the goal of the program.

Implementation may use existing libraries or other code, provided they carefully attributed. A lack of attribution will be considered as plagiarism and the usualaction will be taken for these cases. Please ensure that you read the student handbook regarding how to cite and reference, as well as look at the materials available on the library web page. In addition, the work needs to be done by you and you must not work with others on any code. The contribution of the student relative to the amount of code they have sourced from elsewhere will be assessed when awarding the mark.

Documentation you will need to submit in addition to all source code, shouldbe as follows:
* Brief description of the aims of program
* Analysis of the requirements of the program (1-2 pages)
* Design – may be documented by flow charts, class diagrams etc. (2-4 pages)
* Testing – table of tests to be undertaken to prove that the program achievesits goals (1-2 pages)
* Critique – what worked, what didn’t and what could have been improved (upto 1 page).
